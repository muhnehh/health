## 👋 What is this?

**Shifti+** is your **AI-powered clinic compass** for the UAE.  
It listens when you say:  
> _“My daughter has a fever and I’m in Al Nahda.”_

And it answers with:

- 🏥 A clinic that’s actually open  
- ⏱️ A wait time that won’t age you  
- 🗺️ Directions that consider traffic  
- 📲 A WhatsApp message you can send your spouse  
- 🧠 Calm, in the chaos  

Built for moms, workers, abayas, teens, aunties, tatas — basically, anyone who's ever sat in a plastic chair wondering:  
> _“Did we pick the wrong clinic… again?”_

---

## 🚨 Why we built this

Because healthcare isn’t broken — it’s **blind**.  
Because “just Google it” doesn’t work when your kid’s crying.  
Because **triage-by-guesswork** isn’t a strategy.

And because the **moment before a panic** is when you most need **clarity**.

## 🛠️ What it does (MVP)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28a91425-a2c9-4ab1-b57c-a7c92d238e09)


🗣️ You type or say something like:  
> _“My son has a fever and I’m in Al Nahda.”_

We use AI to extract:
- Symptom  
- Urgency  
- Location  

Then we:
- Find the best 2–3 clinics nearby (mocked for now)  
- Estimate ETA using live traffic (Azure Maps)  
- Display wait times, accepted insurance  
- Recommend the best one  
- Let you share the plan via WhatsApp  
- Work in **Arabic or English**  
- Even support **voice input** (Web Speech API)

- **OpenRouter API / GPT** — NLP triage logic  
- **Azure Maps** — traffic & distance  
- **HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS** — frontend UI  
- **Web Speech API** — for voice commands

## 🌍 Who it’s for

- 👩‍👦 Working moms with one bar left on their patience  
- 👷 Expats with no insurance  
- 👴 Elders who don’t need more waiting  
- 👩‍⚕️ Clinics that want fewer 3-hour walk-ins

---

## 🧪 What’s next?

- Real API integration with clinics & booking platforms  
- Crowd-sourced wait time updates  
- Appointment reminders + “leave now” alerts  
- Expansion to pharmacies, labs, and public hospitals  
- Dark mode (because your child is asleep and so is the clinic)

## ❤️ Final note

This isn’t a “nice-to-have.”  
This is a **why-doesn’t-this-already-exist?**

We didn’t build this for judges.  
We built it for **that parent at 3PM on a Friday** trying to do the right thing.

If this helps just one person skip a waiting room —  
**we’ve already won.**
