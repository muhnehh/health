🩺 Shifti+
“Because your weekend wasn’t made for 3-hour clinic waits.”
👋 What is this?
Shifti+ is your AI-powered clinic compass for the UAE.
It listens when you say “my daughter has a fever” and answers with:

🏥 A nearby clinic that’s actually open

⏱️ A wait time that won’t age you

🗺️ Directions based on traffic

📲 A WhatsApp message to send your spouse

🧠 Calm in the chaos

Built for moms, workers, aunties, abayas, and anyone who’s ever sat in a plastic chair wondering if they made the right choice.

🚨 Why we built this
Because healthcare is hard.
Because we’ve all Googled “clinic near me” only to end up in the wrong part of town.
Because triage-by-guesswork isn’t a strategy.

And mostly — because the moment before a medical panic is when you most need clarity.

🛠️ What it does (MVP)
🗣️ Take a natural language input like:

“My son has a fever and I’m in Al Nahda.”

🧠 We use an LLM to extract:

Symptom

Urgency

Location

📍 Then:

Find 2–3 mock clinics nearby

Show ETA based on traffic

Estimate wait times

Recommend when to leave

Let you share plan via WhatsApp

📱 Works in Arabic or English. With voice input, if typing hurts.

💡 Built with:
Python + FastAPI (backend magic)

HTML + JS (light frontend)

Azure Maps (traffic + distance)

OpenRouter/HuggingFace GPT (symptom triage)

Web Speech API (voice input)

Caffeine, compassion, and 1 good playlist

🌍 Who it’s for
👩‍👦 Working parents with one bar left on their sanity meter

👷 Expats without insurance

👴 Elderly who don’t need more waiting

👩‍⚕️ Clinics that wish people showed up at the right time, not all at once

🧪 What’s Next?
Real API connections to clinics

Real-time crowdsource check-ins

Bookings + queue ticketing

Expansion to pharmacies, labs, and gov health centers

❤️ Final note
This isn’t a “nice-to-have.” It’s a why-didn’t-this-exist-before.
We didn’t build for judges.
We built for that mom at 3PM on a Friday, looking for help.

And if this helps even one person skip the chaos and get care faster —
We’ve already won.
