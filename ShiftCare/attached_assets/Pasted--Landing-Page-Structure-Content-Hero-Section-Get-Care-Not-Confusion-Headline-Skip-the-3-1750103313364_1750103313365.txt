🩺 Problem Section: The Hidden Crisis in UAE Healthcare Access
In Ajman, Sharjah, and across the UAE, families waste hours every weekend trying to get seen.
Clinics are overbooked. Wait times are unpredictable. You don’t know which clinics accept your insurance, or how long you’ll wait.
So we rush. We wait. We guess.
And it costs us more than just time.

Pain Points List (with icons):

❌ 3–4 hour waits even for mild symptoms

❌ No real-time visibility into clinic traffic

❌ No centralized booking or triage

❌ Uncertainty for parents, seniors, workers

❌ Lost income from missed work hours

⚙️ How Shifti+ Works
Step 1: Tell us what’s wrong
Describe your symptoms in plain language. Use voice if you prefer.

Step 2: Get instant triage + recommendations
We analyze your urgency and location, and show the best 2–3 clinics near you.

Step 3: Know when and where to go
Get accurate travel time, wait time, and “leave now” alerts — with directions and shareable WhatsApp links.

Step 4: Check in virtually (coming soon)
Soon, you’ll be able to queue remotely — so you wait at home, not on a hard plastic chair.
